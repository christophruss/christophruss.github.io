I needed a place to put tweaks, hacks, findings or whatever you would like to call it. Others may also find them usefull - at least it will allow me to remember them later on.

I am using the basic jekyll-now repository, which appears to work well. First recommendation is therefore to check out:
[Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
